    "### Part 1: Building the Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to build the dictionary itself! We will need to assign the dictionary to a variable, let's call it `game_dict`. This nested dictionary should be constructed in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The top level of the dictionary has two keys: `:home`, for the home team, and `:away`, for the away team.\n",
    "* The values of the `:home` and `:away` keys are dictionaries. These dictionaries have the following keys:\n",
    "  * `:team_name`\n",
    "  * `:colors`\n",
    "  * `:players`\n",
    "* The `:team_name` key points to a string of the team name.\n",
    "* The `:colors` key points to an array of strings that are that team's colors.\n",
    "* The `:players` key points to a hash of players whose names (as strings) are the keys to a hash containing their stats. The values for each player's names and their stats can be found in the table below. The stats keys should be formatted like this:\n",
    "    * `:number`\n",
    "    * `:shoe`\n",
    "    * `:points`\n",
    "    * `:rebounds`\n",

    "### Step 2: Building Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Methods within Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be building a series of methods that operate on the above game hash to return certain information about the teams and players. Each method will operate on the game hash by calling the `game_hash` method that returns the `game_hash`. In other words, since our `game_hash` method returns our hash, you can think of the `game_hash` like a variable that points to our hash and operate on it just as you would with hashes in previous lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to build a method, `home_team_name`, that returns the name of the home team, `\"Brooklyn Nets\"`. We can call the method `game_hash` inside of our `home_team_name` method and operate on the game_hash:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "def home_team_name\n",
    "  game_hash[:home][:team_name]\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "puts home_team_name\n",
    "# => \"Brooklyn Nets\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how we are going to operate on the `game_hash` inside of the methods we're building, let's build those methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating through Nested Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab requires us to iterate through the many levels of our nested hash. DON'T TAKE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR HASH FOR GRANTED. Every time you iterate into a new level of the hash, immediately place a `binding.pry` there. Then, run RSpec with the `learn` command to see what the key/value pairs of that hash are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "def good_practices\n",
    "  game_hash.each do |location, team_data|\n",
    "    #are you ABSOLUTELY SURE what 'location' and 'team data' are? use binding.pry to find out!\n",
    "    binding.pry\n",
    "      team_data.each do |attribute, data|\n",
    "        #are you ABSOLUTELY SURE what 'attribute' and 'team data' are? use binding.pry to find out!\n",
    "        binding.pry\n",
    "\n",
    "        #what is 'data' at each loop through out .each block? when will the following line of code work and when will it break?\n",
    "        data.each do |data_item|\n",
    "            binding.pry\n",
    "      end\n",
    "    end\n",
    "  end\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up the `hashketball.rb` file and add the line *require \"pry\"* at the top and copy and paste the above method. Then, beneath the `end` that closes the method definition, call the method (`good_practices`) and, in your terminal, run the file with `ruby hashketball.rb`. Play around with the methods in each binding until you get comfortable with the iteration. This should give you a stronger sense of how we iterate through so many levels of a nested hash and what happens on each level. **Use this method of placing LOTS of bindings when you iterate in order to solve this lab.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, *now* we're ready to build out methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Building\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a method, `num_points_scored` that takes in an argument of a player's name and returns the number of points scored for that player.\n",
    "  * Think about where in the hash you will find a player's `:points`. How can you iterate down into that level? Think about the return value of your method. Remember that `.each` returns the original collection that you are iterating over. How can you return the number of points for a particular player?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a method, `shoe_size`, that takes in an argument of a player's name and returns the shoe size for that player.\n",
    "  * Think about how you will find the shoe size of the correct player. How can you check and see if a player's name matches the name that has been passed into the method as an argument?\n",
    "* Build a method, `team_colors`, that takes in an argument of the team name and returns an array of that teams colors.\n",
    "* Build a method, `team_names`, that operates on the game hash to return an array of the team names.\n",
    "* Build a method, `player_numbers`, that takes in an argument of a team name and returns an array of the jersey number's for that team.\n",
    "* Build a method, `player_stats`, that takes in an argument of a player's name and returns a hash of that player's stats.\n",
    "  * Check out the following example of the expected return value of the `player_stats` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    player_stats(\"Alan Anderson\")\n",
    "    => { :number => 0,\n",
    "         :shoe => 16,\n",
    "         :points => 22,\n",
    "         :rebounds => 12,\n",
    "         :assists => 12,\n",
    "         :steals => 3,\n",
    "         :blocks => 1,\n",
    "         :slam_dunks => 1\n",
    "       }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a method, `big_shoe_rebounds`, that will return the number of rebounds associated with the player that has the largest shoe size. Break this one down into steps:\n",
    "  * First, find the player with the largest shoe size\n",
    "  * Then, return that player's number of rebounds\n",
    "  * Remember to think about return values here. Use `binding.pry` to drop into your method and understand what it is returning and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which player has the most points? Call the method `most_points_scored`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which team has the most points? Call the method `winning_team`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which player has the longest name? Call the method `player_with_longest_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Super Bonus:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the most steals. Call the method `long_name_steals_a_ton?`.\n",
